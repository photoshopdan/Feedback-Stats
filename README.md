## Feedback-Stats

A quick prototype which parses the summary.csv generated by the barcoding app and outputs nicely presented stats about photographer performance.

A number of valuable insights can be recovered from data that is otherwise only used for one purpose and discarded. The data can be used to construct a nicely formatted HTML email with graphs illustrating various performance metrics, which can then be sent to the revelant photographer automatically. By sending feedback the moment the images reach the office and are processed, the photographer is able to correct any mistakes *before* they are able to repeat them in subsequent jobs.
